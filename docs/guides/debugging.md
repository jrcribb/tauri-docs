# Debugging

With all the moving pieces in Tauri, you may run into a problem that requires debugging. There are many locations where error details are printed, and Tauri includes some tools to make the debugging process more straightforward.

## Rust Console

The first place to look for errors is in the Rust Console. This is in the terminal where you ran, e.g., Tauri dev. You can use the following code to print something to that console from within a Rust file:

```rust
println!("Message from Rust: {}", msg);
```

Sometimes you may have an error in your Rust code, and the Rust compiler can give you lots of information. If, for example, `tauri dev` crashes, you can rerun it like this on Linux and macOS:

```bash
RUST_DEBUG=1 tauri dev
```

or like this on MS Windows:

```bash
set RUST_DEBUG=1
tauri dev
```

This command gives you a granular stack trace. Generally speaking, the Rust compiler helps you by
giving you detailed information about the issue, such as:

```
error[E0425]: cannot find value `sun` in this scope
  --> src/main.rs:11:5
   |
11 |     sun += i.to_string().parse::<u64>().unwrap();
   |     ^^^ help: a local variable with a similar name exists: `sum`

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0425`.
```

## WebView JS Console

Right-click in the WebView, and choose `Inspect Element`. This opens up a web-inspector similar to the Chrome or Firefox dev tools you are used to.

## Create a Debug Build

There are cases where you might need to inspect the JS console in the final bundle, so Tauri provides a simple command to create a debugging bundle:

<Command name="build --debug" />

Like the normal build and dev processes, building takes some time the first time you run this command but is significantly faster on subsequent runs.
The final bundled app has the development console enabled and is placed in `src-tauri/target/debug/bundle`.

## Run Your App From the Terminal

You can also run a built app from the terminal, giving you the Rust compiler notes (in case of errors) or your `println` messages. Just find the file `src-tauri/target/(release|debug)/[app name]` and either double click it (but be warned, the terminal closes on errors) or just run it in directly in your console.
